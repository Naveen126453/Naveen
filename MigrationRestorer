MigrationRestorer Plugin Description
The MigrationRestorer plugin is a Thunder (WPEFramework) plugin designed to restore device settings after migration or onboarding. Its main purpose is to ensure that user preferences and system configurations are seamlessly transferred and applied on a device, typically after a factory reset, upgrade, or migration from another device.

Key Responsibilities
Loading Migration Data:
Reads a JSON file containing migrated settings (e.g., display, audio, accessibility, parental controls, HDMI, and system info) from a secure location on the device.

Schema Validation:
Loads a JSON schema file and validates each setting in the migration data against this schema to ensure correctness and compatibility.

Applying Settings:
Applies validated settings to the device using platform APIs and Thunder plugin interfaces. For example, it uses IUserSettings for user preferences and IHdmiCecSink for HDMI-related settings.

API Exposure:
Exposes JSON-RPC methods (such as ApplyDisplaySettings) so other components or remote clients can trigger the restoration of settings.

Component Readiness:
Tracks which subsystems are ready to receive settings, ensuring that settings are only applied when appropriate.

Error Handling and Logging:
Includes robust error handling and logging for troubleshooting and auditing migration operations.

Main Features
Initialization:
On startup, loads migration data and schema, validates all entries, and prepares for restoration.

Validation:
Ensures only valid and supported settings are applied, preventing misconfiguration.

Extensibility:
Designed to support additional settings and components as needed.

Security:
Operates on secure data paths and validates all input to prevent unauthorized or malformed settings from being applied.

Typical Use Case
After a device migration, a management system or user triggers the plugin (via JSON-RPC) to restore all relevant settings. The plugin validates and applies each setting, ensuring the device is configured as expected for the user.

Summary:
The MigrationRestorer plugin automates and secures the restoration of device settings after migration, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience. 
It is modular, extensible, and integrates tightly with the Thunder framework and platform APIs.

MigrationRestorer.h
This header defines the MigrationRestorer plugin class for WPEFramework. Key points:

Inheritance:
Inherits from PluginHost::IPlugin and PluginHost::JSONRPC, making it a Thunder plugin with JSON-RPC API support.

Core Methods:

Initialize, Deinitialize, Information: Standard plugin lifecycle methods.
RegisterAll, UnregisterAll: Register/unregister JSON-RPC methods.
PopulateMigrationDataStore, PopulateMigrationDataStoreSchema, ValidateMigrationDataStore: Load and validate migration data and schema.
ApplyDisplaySettings: Main API to apply validated settings.
Data Members:

Maps for input data and schema (inputMap, schemaMap).
List of validated keys (validatedkeys).
Pointers to plugin interfaces for user settings and HDMI CEC sink.
MigrationRestorer.cpp
This file implements the logic for the plugin. Main flow:

Constructor:

Loads migration data from a JSON file and schema from another JSON file.
Validates each setting in the data store against the schema, storing valid keys.
Data Loading:

PopulateMigrationDataStore: Reads and parses migration data JSON, populates inputMap.
PopulateMigrationDataStoreSchema: Reads and parses schema JSON, populates schemaMap.
Validation:

ValidateMigrationDataStore: For each key in the input, checks if it exists in the schema and validates its value using validateValue.
validateValue: Recursively checks types, enums, ranges, and references in the schema.
Applying Settings:

ApplyDisplaySettings: Iterates over validated keys and applies each setting using platform APIs or Thunder plugin interfaces.
Handles settings like resolution, audio, accessibility, parental controls, HDMI control, device location, and zoom.
Uses helper plugins (IUserSettings, IHdmiCecSink) for some settings.
Plugin Lifecycle:

Initialize and Deinitialize manage plugin startup/shutdown and resource cleanup.
Summary:
The MigrationRestorer plugin loads device settings from a migration data store, validates them against a schema, 
and applies them to the device using platform and Thunder APIs. The header defines the structure and API,
while the implementation handles data parsing, validation, and application logic.
